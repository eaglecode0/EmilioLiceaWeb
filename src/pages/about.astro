<p>Hey! I'm Emilio â€” I'm passionate about math and code.</p>

  <p>I genuinely believe that even the most complex ideas can be broken down into simple, intuitive ones â€” the kind that anyone can truly grasp.</p>

  <p>This site is a space where I share what I'm learning, building, and thinking about.</p>

  <p>Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to reach out if you're working on something cool â€” or if you just want to chat about the beauty of a good equation. ðŸ™‚</p>

  <ul>
    <li>My full name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
    <li>I live in {identity.country}.</li>
    {identity.hobbies.length >= 2 &&
